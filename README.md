# Forecast bikeshare demand using time series models in R

## About this project
A bike rental company is looking to improve its demand forecasting accuracy to optimize its fleet management and pricing strategy. They collect data on daily rental transactions and want to use it to predict future demand. 

The company aims to use the forecasts to determine the optimal number of bikes to keep in each station and to set dynamic pricing based on the predicted demand. Making these forecasts will enhance the company's logistic processes, help reduce costs, and maximize profits.

## Project Objectives
1. Describe data to answer key questions to uncover insights
2. Fit well-validated time series models for forecasting future rental bikes demands
3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations

## Dataset
In this project, we'll use a data set containing the hourly and daily count of rental bikes between the years 2011 and 2012 in the Capital bike share system in Washington, DC, with the corresponding weather and seasonal information.

## Tasks
1. Load data and install packages
2. Import required packages
3. Describe and explore the data
4. Create interactive time series plots with the timetk package
5. Smooth time series data
6. Decompse and access the stationarity of time series data
7. Fit and forecast time series data using ARIMA models
8. Findings and Conclusions
